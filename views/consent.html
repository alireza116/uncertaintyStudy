                <h1>Consent to Participate in a Research Study</h1>
                <ul>
                <li>You are invited to participate in a study conducted by researchers at University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Participation in this research study is voluntary. The information provided is to give you key information to help you decide whether or not to participate.</li>
                <li>Project Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of public opinion formation in conflicting situations that affect society at large.</li>
                    <li>Eligibility: You are eligible to participate in this study if you are able to read and write in English and at least 18 years old.</li>
                Overall Description of Participation: You will be introduced to a series of legislative bills that have been proposed at either national or state levels. For each bill, you will be asked about your level of familiarity and opinion towards each issue. You will then have the opportunity to read a series of opinions and insights shared by others on each of these programs, after which you will be asked to state your position. You are free to decide how many messages to read prior to making a judgment about the program. You will also asked a series of short general demographic questions. These questions are not sensitive or overly personal.</li>
                <li>Length of Participation: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete the study.</li>
                    <li>Risks and Benefits of Participation: There are no known or foreseeable risks involved in this research study. Besides Amazon MTurk compensation, you will not benefit personally by participating in this study. The broader benefits of this research may include increased understanding of how opinions are formed in online settings.</li>
                <li>Participation is voluntary. You may choose not to take part in the study. You may start participating and change your mind and stop participation at any time without any penalty. However, you will only be eligible for payment through Amazon MTurk upon completion of the study. When you complete the survey, you will be provided a unique code that you may then enter on Amazon MTurk to receive payment.
                Your privacy will be protected and confidentiality will be maintained to the extent possible. Your responses will be treated as confidential and will not be linked to your identity. We might use the survey data for future research studies and we might share the non-identifiable survey data with other researchers for future research studies without additional consent from you.
                If you have questions concerning the study, contact the principal investigator, Dr. Doug Markant at 662-736-8450 or dmarkant@uncc.edu. If you have further questions or concerns about your rights as a participant in this study, contact the Office of Research Compliance at (704) 687-1871 or uncc-irb@uncc.edu.
                You may print a copy of this form.</li>
                <li>If you are 18 years of age or older, have read and understood the information provided and freely consent to participate in the study, you may proceed to the study.</li>
